    Past Courses<br><br>Spring 2022 Semester<br>
    Why We Write: World Wide Web at Rutgers Mason Gross School of the Arts in the MFA in Design Program<br>
    Co-taught with Emma Rae Bruml Norton<br><br>
 
    <br>This course introduces the history, concepts and methods of creating websites as tools for communication and as experiences.<br>
	But we begin with the proposition that all coding is first and foremost writing. The theme: why we write. We will begin a writing<br>
	practice together. We will engage with and create poetic language and thought, and see what is revealed to us in turn.<br>
	Through readings, tutorials, studio work, and critiques we will construct bodies of writing that we can build upon and share<br>
	with one another and the world (wide web).<br><br> 

	The semester will be broken up into 8 themes: “Remember,” “Create New Grammars & Sound,” “Open, Links, Extends,” “Poetics of Excess & Overflow,”<br>
	“Make Declarations,” “Reflect & Refract the Logic of the Present,” “Record the Details,” and “Layer.” Through these themes,<br>
	we will learn how to write code and we will learn how to write poetry and we will see where they become close and where they become<br>
	distant from one another.<br><br>

	Everything we write will make it into a web document and onto a web server. In other words, we will overtime be making our own<br>
	websites full of text. <a href="https://whywewrite.world/">More info at whywewrite.world</a>

WORKSHOP | Poetry: Writing the Unspectacular at the Loft Literary Center in Minneapolis, MN.<br><br>
As a 4-week Course in Spring 2022 & a 1-day Course in 2021<br>
Often we write with the belief that there is our “art” and then there is our “life”—that the actual mechanics of how we get from day to day<br>
		(how we support ourselves financially, for example) have no place in our writing. In this generative poetry workshop, we’ll dismantle this idea,<br>
    and begin a writing process together that centers the unspectacular—the grind, credit card debt, tasks, toil—in an effort to bridge the<br>
    linguistic and the lived, to write more truthfully, and see what emerges. <br><br><br>

WORKSHOP | Opening The Mind’s Eye: Ekphrastic Poetry Workshop<br> 
John Chamberlain : Photographs<br>
Pile onto John Chamberlain’s couch sculpture and create ekphrastic poetry in response to Chamberlain’s intuitive, colorful and humorous photographic<br>
series that Chamberlain once described as “self portraits of the nervous system”. Since Homer, poets have turned towards ekphrasis to approach works<br>
of art—the artwork functioning as a muse, or as a means by which the poet can critically examine something outside of the artwork, using the work as an entry<br>
point from which to do so. This workshop will guide you through this experimental form of prose through readings, creative activities, and conversation.<br>
We’ll discuss traditional<br> ekphrasis and explore more contemporary visions of it too—seeing how far we can stretch its definition.<br><br>
 <br><br><br>
